## Introduction 
This is a mazegenerator I created to improve my java skills and understanding in graph theory. It randomly generates mazes with dimensions 5x5 - 10x10 using a randomized depth search algorithm.

## Technologies

* Java
* Java Swing
* Junit
* Maven
* Command-line
* Github

## What I've learned
-How to make GUIs with Java Swing
-How to do unit testing with Juinit
-How to use maven package manager for Java
-How to conduct a randomized depth first search on a graph

## How to use
Run in the commandline
